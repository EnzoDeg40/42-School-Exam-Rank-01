Write a function that takes as parameters a sorted array of integers, its size,
and an integer n. The function should return the first number in the array
greater than n.

For example, with an array of 5 integers containing 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and n = 5,
the function should return 7, as 7 is the first number greater than 5 in the
array.

Your function must be declared as follows:

int	number_above(int *tab, int size, int n);
```
